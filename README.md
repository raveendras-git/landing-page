# landing-page
Hello! This my first small website project.

# What I Did
I make one file index.html and one more style.css.
I write basic HTML structure and link css file.
Add one header with logo and some links like home, about, contact.
Then I create hero section with one big heading, small text and one button say "Get Started".
Use flexbox for nice layout and align things center.
Add footer also, with some social links.
Then I test in live server and resize window to check if look good in mobile and small screen.
